I. Introduction

   This code base consists of algorithms for fitting factor models written in
   R and C/C++.  The entry point of any fitting algorithm is in R.  The
   computationally intensive parts are written in C/C++. The models and 
   algorithms have been described in the following papers.

II. Tutorial

   See doc/tutorial.pdf for a tutorial on how to use this package to fit
   latent factor models.

III. Compilation

   You need to have R installed before compiling the code.
   To install R, see: http://www.r-project.org/
   You have to install R from source on a linux machine.
   It is recommended to use R version >= 2.10.1.
   
   The following R packages also need to be installed.
      Matrix
      glmnet
   
   To compile the C/C++ code, just type make.

IV. Examples

   See: src/R/examples/multicontext_model.R
