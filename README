I. Introduction

   This code base consists of algorithms for fitting factor models written in
   R and C/C++.  The entry point of any fitting algorithm is in R.  The
   computationally intensive parts are written in C/C++. The models and 
   algorithms have been described in the following papers.

II. Tutorial

   See doc/tutorial.pdf for a tutorial on how to use this package to fit
   the latent factor models described in [1,2].

III. Compilation

   You need to have R installed before compiling the code.
   To install R, see: http://www.r-project.org/
   You have to install R from source on a linux machine.
   It is recommended to use R version >= 2.10.1.
   
   The following R packages also need to be installed.
      Matrix
      glmnet
   
   To compile the C/C++ code, just type make.

IV. Examples

   Localized factor model (multi-context, multi-application factorization) [2]:
        src/multi-app/R/example/fitting.R

   fLDA model (LDA topic modeling + Matrix factorization) [5]:
        src/LDA-RLFM/R/model/examples.R
