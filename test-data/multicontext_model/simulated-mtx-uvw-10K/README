
Simulated Data for Testing Multi-Context Models
Code: src/unit-test/multicontext_model/create-simulated-data-1.R

FILE: obs-{train,test}.txt
      These are the observed ratings for training and test.
      Columns:
        1. src_id: User ID
        2. dst_id: Item ID
        3. src_context: The mode of the user when rating the item
        4. dst_context: The mode of the item when rated by the user
        5. ctx_id: The context when the user gives the rating to the item
        6. y: The rating value

FILE: dense-feature-user.txt
      This is the user feature table in the dense format.
      Columns:
        1. src_id: User ID (primary key of this table).
           The src_id in obs-{train,test}.txt refers to this.
        2. feature_1
        3. feature_2
        4. feature_3

FILE: dense-feature-item.txt
      This is the item feature table in the dense format.
      Columns:
        1. dst_id: Item ID (primary key of this table)
           The dst_id in obs-{train,test}.txt refers to this.
        2. feature_1
        3. feature_2
        4. feature_3

FILE: dense-feature-ctxt.txt
      This is the rating-context feature table in the dense format.
      Columns:
        1. ctx_id: Context ID (primary key of this table)
           The ctx_id in obs-{train,test}.txt refers to this.
        2. feature_1

FILE: dense-feature-obs-{train,test}.txt
      These are the observation feature table of the training and test ratings
      in the dense format.  The i-th line of dense-feature-obs-train.txt
      specifies the feature vector of the i-th line of obs-train.txt, these
      are the features associated with the event when the user rates the item
      (e.g., time of day of the event).
      Columns:
        1. feature_1
        2. feature_2

FILE: sparse-feature-{user,item,ctxt}.txt
      Feature tables for users, items and rating-contexts in the sparse format.
      Same as dense-feature-{user,item,ctxt}.txt, but in the sparse format.
      Columns:
        1. src_id, dst_id or ctx_id
        2. index: Feature index (start from 1, not 0)
        3. value: Feature value
      Example:
        sparse-feature-user.txt      dense-feature-user.txt
        SPARSE FORMAT           <=>  DENSE FORMAT
         src_id  index   value        src_id   feature_1  feature_2  feature_3
             15      2  -0.978            15           0     -0.978      0.031
             15      3   0.031

FILE: sparse-feature-obs-{train,test}.txt
      Same as dense-feature-obs-{train,test}.txt, but in the sparse format.
      Columns:
        1. obs_id: Line number (start from 1, not 0)
        2. index: Feature index (start from 1, not 0)
        3. value: Feature value
      Example: sparse-feature-obs-train.txt
        obs_id   index   value   # MEANING
             9       1    0.14   # 1st feature of line  9 in obs-train.txt = 0.14
             9       2   -0.93   # 2nd feature of line  9 in obs-train.txt =-0.93
            10       1   -0.91   # 1st feature of line 10 in obs-train.txt =-0.91
