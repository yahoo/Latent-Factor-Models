\title{LDA-based Regression Latent Factor Models}
\author{Bee-Chung Chen and Deepak Agarwal}
\maketitle

Consider article recommendation, where articles consist of terms (words). LDA is an attractive model that summarizes terms into topics, which then provide a small set of interpretable features (reduced from the set of all terms to a small number of topics) for articles. In document, we explore the use of LDA in RLFM.
