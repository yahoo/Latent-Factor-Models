    sum(x) - x[1] - x[2] - ... - x[length(x)] may not be exactly zero.
    cnt_item_topic, etc, can be NEGATIVE!!

2009-08-09 Test MC_predict (C vs R)
    Use Monte-Carlo mean to make prediction may get worse RMSE.
        E.g., simulation with var_FACTOR = 0.01.
    Because of small differences, the C eigenvector can be different from the R eigenvector (e.g., change in the sign).
        This can cause the multivariate normal sample to be different (e.g., when drawing samples for u, v, or s).
    C and R versions basically match (modulo the above eigenvector problem)

2009-07-19 Test LDA-RLFM code vs. RLFM code
    Case:  5 factors -> new code vs old code has error < 1e-12  (single EM)
    Case: 10 factors -> new code vs old code may have max error ~ 0.8 in factors, max error ~0.03 in param (single EM)
          Sometimes one has a higher CDlogLik; sometimes the other has a higher CDlogLik.
    Old code when using MC_EStep.C  faster than new code (Exec time of old code is 1/2 to 2/3 of that of the new code)
    Old code when using MC_EStep2.C as fast as new code
