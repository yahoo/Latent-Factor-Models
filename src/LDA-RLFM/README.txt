This directory contains code for fitting the fLDA model as described in the 
following paper:

       Deepak Agarwal, Bee-Chung Chen. fLDA: Matrix factorization through 
       latent Dirichlet allocation. WSDM 2010.

The model combines matrix factorization with LDA topic modeling.

Quick start:

(1) Look at doc/LDA-based-RLFM.tex
(2) Look at Notation.txt for naming convention and model specification.
(3) Compile C/C++ code by typing make in this directory.
(4) Look at R/model/examples.R for how to fit a model and do prediction using the model.
